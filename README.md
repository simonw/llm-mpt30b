Plugin for [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) adding support for the [MPT-30B language model](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b).

> ⚠️ This plugin is in development, and will not work until the next release of LLM. See [this PR](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/65) for progress.

This plugin uses [TheBloke/mpt-30B-GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/mpt-30B-GGML). The code was inspired by [abacaj/mpt-30B-inference](https://github.com/abacaj/mpt-30B-inference).

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as LLM.
```bash
llm install llm-mpt30b
```
After installing the plugin you will need to download the ~19GB model file. You can do this by running:

```bash
llm mpt30b download
```

## Usage

This plugin adds a model called `mpt30b`. You can execute it like this:

```bash
llm -m mpt30b "Three great names for a pet goat"
```
The alias `-m mpt` works as well.

You can pass the option `-o verbose 1` to see more verbose output - currently a progress bar showing any additional downloads that are made during execution.

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd llm-mpt30b
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest
